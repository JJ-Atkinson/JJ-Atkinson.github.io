I'm just your not-average college student.

I'm highly interested in Clojure(Script), Fulcro, and Rich Hickey talks, and am trying to learn (from) them as best I can. 

**Tools I use:**

 - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) <= This may be the most important one of all ;)
 - [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com)
   - I have an eye towards switching to a workspace with code blocks, either [LightTable](http://lighttable.com) when updated, or a tool of my own design. 
 - [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)
